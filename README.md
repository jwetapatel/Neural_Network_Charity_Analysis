# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

The purpose of this project is to use deep-learning neural networks with the TensorFlow platform in Python, to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.
We use the following methods for the analysis:

- Compare the differences between the traditional machine learning classification and regression models and the neural network models.

- Implement neural network models using TensorFlow.

- Preprocess and construct datasets for neural network models.

- Compare the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks.

- Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow.
